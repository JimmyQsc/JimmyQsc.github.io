## Let Down - by Radiohead

> One day I am gonna grow wings, a chemical reaction, hysterical and useless.

有一天，我会长出翅膀，就像化学反应，歇斯底里却毫无用处。

> Transport, motorways and tramlines, starting and then stopping, taking off and landing.

交通工具，出发然后停下，起飞然后降落。

> Shell smashed, juices flowing, wings twitch, legs are going. don't get sentimental, it always ends up drivel. 

壳被击碎，体液流淌，翅膀抽搐，腿也脱落。不要多愁善感，它使你胡言乱语。
