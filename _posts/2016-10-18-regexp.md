>Part of knowing how to use regular expression is to resisting the urge to try to shoehorn things that cannot sanely express in to them. - _Eloquent JavaScript_

## RegExp.prototype.test()
input: string, output: boolean.
use: executes a search for a match between a regular expression and a specified string. 
it tests whether a pattern is *found* in a string.

## RegExp.prototype.exec()
input: string, output: array/null.
use: executes a search for a match in a specified string,

### return: array has the matched text as first item, and then one for each captured text in teh matched text, only the first match is returned.
### side effect: updates the property of the regular expression object 

## String.prototype.match()
input: RegExp, output: array.
use: retrives the matches when matching a string against a regular expression.

### return: similiar to RegExp.property.exec(), If the regular expression includes the g flag, the method returns an Array containing all matched substrings rather than match objects.

```javascript

var input = "A string with 3 numbers in it... 42 and 88.";
var number = /\b(\d+)\b/g;
var match;
while (match = number.exec(input)){
    console.log(match);
}
// -> ["3", "3", index: 14, input: "A string with 3 numbers in it... 42 and 88."]
// -> ["42", "42", index: 33, input: "A string with 3 numbers in it... 42 and 88."]
// -> ["88", "88", index: 40, input: "A string with 3 numbers in it... 42 and 88."]
```
